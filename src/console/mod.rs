//! Console module — stateful text output for the AgnostOs kernel.
//!
//! Manages a [`KWriter`] instance that owns the framebuffer reference,
//! cursor position, font size, and screen/command history. All text
//! output goes through [`_kprint`] (via the [`kprint!`]/[`kprintln!`] macros),
//! which acquires the [`KWRITER`] lock and calls [`fmt::Write`] on it.
//!
//! # Features
//! - Scrolling terminal output with configurable scroll threshold
//! - Command history navigation (up/down arrow keys)
//! - Font size switching with history redraw (zoom in/out)
//! - Block cursor rendering
//! - Backspace with visual erase
